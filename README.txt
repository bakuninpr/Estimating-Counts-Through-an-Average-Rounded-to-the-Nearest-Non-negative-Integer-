Brief description by file:

 RRoR - provides code to determine Relative Risk of Rounding metrics in the case of Y following a Poisson, binomial,
or negative binomial distribution. It outputs numerical results and figures.
binned-binomial - main code for application of drawing inference on probability of success of a binomial distribution
using U
Rcode_Rounded_Poisson - sanity check code to verify theoretical results of moments when Y~Poisson()
